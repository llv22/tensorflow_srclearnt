**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow also includes [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard), a data visualization toolkit.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable Python API and C APIs as well as without API backwards compatibility guarantee like C++, Go, Java, JavaScript and Swift.
